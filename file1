					GIT HUB

GitHub is a web-based Git or version control repository and Internet hosting service. It is mostly used for code. 
It offers all of the distributed version control and source code management (SCM) functionality of Git as well as adding its own 
features. It provides access control and several collaboration features such as bug tracking, feature requests, task management, 
and wikis for every project.

GitHub offers both plans for private and free repositories on the same account which are commonly used to host open-source software
projects. As of April 2017, GitHub reports having almost 20 million users and 57 million repositories, making it the largest host
of source code in the world.

                                        SCOPE
GitHub is mostly used for code.
In addition to source code, GitHub supports the following formats and features:
    Documentation, including automatically rendered README files in a variety of Markdown-like file formats (see README files on GitHub)
    Issue tracking (including feature requests) with labels, milestones, assignees and a search engine
    Pull requests with code review and comments
    Commits history
    Graphs: pulse, contributors, commits, code frequency, punch card, network, members
    Integrations Directory
    Unified and split diffs
    Email notifications
    Option to subscribe someone to notifications by @ mentioning them.
    GitHub Pages: small websites can be hosted from public repositories on GitHub. The URL format is http://username.github.io.
    Nested task-lists within files
    Visualization of geospatial data
    3D render files that can be previewed using a new integrated STL file viewer that displays the files on a "3D canvas".The viewer 
    is powered by WebGL and Three.js.
    Photoshop's native PSD format can be previewed and compared to previous versions of the same file.

    
                                      Licensing of repositories
GitHub's Terms of Service do not require public software projects hosted on GitHub to meet the Open Source Definition. 
For that reason, it is essential for users and developers intending to use a piece of software found on GitHub to read the software 
license in the repository (usually found in a top-level file called "LICENSE", "LICENSE.txt", or similar) to determine if it meets
their needs[citation needed]. The Terms of Service state, "By setting your repositories to be viewed publicly, you agree to allow 
others to view and fork your repositories."
